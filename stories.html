                      <h6 style="color: white" > <center>It was another quiet day; the crisp fall breeze chilled the air and brushed the fallen leaves across the street. 
					  Sam strolled along the sidewalk of the neighborhood, listening to some alternative rock and enjoying the quietness of the morning. 
					  The neighborhood was silent, aside from the occasional scratching of leaves over the pavement and the low drone of the music coming from his headphones. 
					  He walked leisurely until he reached the end of the street. Across the way was a heavily wooded area, a popular local spot for neighborhood kids to play and explore. 
					  He started walking perpendicular to the woods, intending to circle back to his house a few blocks down. <br/>
					   <br/>
						Out of the corner of his eye he saw something dart into the woods. Sam turned toward the woods and saw a figure poking out between the branches of a tree. 
						It appeared to be beckoning him to come closer. Something about the figure seemed more friendly than scary, almost familiar. 
						It was dressed in a silvery gown and seemed to exude warmth. He crept closer, cautiously keeping his distance. 
						As he approached the edge of the woods, he got clearer look at the figure: it was a girl! Her voice was soft and gentle; she introduced herself as Judith.
						He asked her what she was doing, to which she simply smiled and ran off. Sam stood watching her run off and was filled with a strange desire to see where she was headed. 
						He followed her, the glow from her gown a beacon among the trees. He reached a clearing in the middle of the woods and froze.
						In the middle stood a stone archway that looked as if it were thousands of years old.
						Sam had been through these woods hundreds of times throughout his childhood and had never seen this structure, nor this clearing.
						Judith waited at the entrance of the archway, smiling brightly. She walked through and disappeared, her glow vanishing from the field.
						Sam’s heart raced and his adrenaline pumped; he shed any doubts and sprinted into the archway. <br/>
						<br/>
						 Stumbling out of the archway, he froze in place, his eyes wide with disbelief. The trees of the clearing were replaced with towering fungi and flowers the size of buildings.
						 Judith beckoned him over to a creature resembling a Pegasus. Sam was petrified; where was he? 
						 Judith swept him up; they flew across fields covered in fluffy purple puffs, over a mountain range with an active volcano spewing icy lava, and through a forest consisting of massive mangrove trees.
						 They landed in front of a majestic palace, situated in the middle of a city floating atop a sea of clouds.
						 As the pair disembarked the Pegasus and enter the palace, a small cohort of gnomes welcomed the travelers.
						 They entered an oddly comfortable room in the middle of the palace, greeted by a gleaming couple, who appeared with tears in their eyes. 
						 The man bellowed, “Welcome home, my son”. </center>

                      <h6 style="color: white" > <center> <i>Another day, another dollar.</i> Same as every other day, Tucker repeats this mantra to himself as he walks across town to the dreary,
					  bland building where he works. <i>Another day, another dollar.</i> Life has not always been kind to Tucker; he is a 37-year-old man who put all his stock into his future, 
					  often disregarding immediate relationships in hopes of the dream that “I’m gonna be someone important, then I’ll have time for friends”. 
					  <i> Another day, another dollar.</i> He has spent every week day of the past sixteen years working in data entry at some multi-million-dollar company,
					  plugging one number after another into Excel files that are supposed to help higher-ups keep track of various financial aspects of the company, but who knows. 
					  It is a thankless, menial job. Another day, another dollar.  <br/>
					   <br/>
						Tucker arrives at the office building in the downtown area, illuminated by dim fluorescent lights, half of which flicker erratically. 
						One hour, two hours, three hours pass. Tucker’s fingers, almost automatically, punch in number after number, his eyes repeatedly dash from computer screen to file folder. 
						Four hours, five hours, six hours. For lunch, he once again brought a tuna sandwich with a bag of Lay’s potato chips, the same lunch he has had for the past eight years.
						He used to buy bologna, but the price of meat has steadily rose, while tuna has stayed the same, so he switched to tuna. Seven hours, eight hours, nine hours. 
						Time to go home. Tucker walks back to his apartment, his path lit by beaming street lamps. Once he gets home, he heats up a Stouffer’s microwave meatloaf dinner,
						changes into a pair of sweatpants and an old t shirt, and turns on Family Feud. Around 9:42 p.m. he falls asleep in his chair; 
						he ends up sleeping there more than he does his bed most nights.  <br/>
						<br/>
						 “Wake up, you fool!” Tucker jerks awake, scrambling out of his chair, drenched in sweat and discombobulated, as he attempts to find out where that voice came from, 
						 if anywhere at all. The room was dark, illuminated only faintly by the street lamps placed across the street. 
						 “Who’s there?!”, Tucker shouted into the darkness, peering into the dark void that is his bedroom. “What do you want from me?!” No reply. 
						 He sits back down in his chair and puts his head in his hands, wondering if it was just a dream that woke him up.
						 In the corner of the room, the darkness seemed to move, swirling slowly.<br/>
						<br/>
						“Why hello there, my dreary friend.” Tucker jolts back, as a grinning face suddenly appears from the swirling darkness in the corner.
						“Wh-what?! Where did you come from?” Tucker exclaims. The entity stood still, grinning menacingly, but aside from the wide smile, 
						Tucker could not quite tell any other features; it just looked like slightly-darker darkness. He was paralyzed by fear, not even able to utter a single word at this point.
						The shadow tilted his head, looked around the room, then rushed forward, lunging at him. Tucker immediately bolted up from his chair,
						holding his fists defensively in front of his face, sweating profusely and suddenly out of breath. 
						<i>What the hell? Was that all a dream? </i> he thought to himself, still reeling from that experience. Tucker looked around the room for whatever that was,
						but he didn’t see anything unusual. Whatever it was had disappeared, if it was even there in the first place. He looked at the clock on the cable box under his television;
						4:51 p.m. <i>It must have been a dream. It had to have been a dream. It just…seemed so real... </i> Given that he was already awake, 
						he decided to make himself some coffee and a plate of about four to seven eggs for breakfast.  </center>
