             Having studied anthropology for several years and through my own life experiences,
			I can firmly state that storytelling is an integral part of what makes humans, human. 
			Whether the story ends in a happily-ever-after or a tragic cliffhanger, stories of all sorts captivate readers, viewers,
			and listeners in all forms of media, including verbal storytelling. <br/>
			<br/>
			 For as long as I can remember I have had a passion for writing and storytelling. 
			I love a good story that hooks me and keeps me coming back for more. For easy examples, look no further than Star Wars or Harry Potter; both of these
			pop culture powerhouses exemplify compelling storytelling, which is a major reason why they are such powerhouses in the first place.
			While I have made attempts at writing in the past with the hopes of creating something even a sliver as inspirational, I have learned along the way that 
			I do not have any great stories rattling around in my head. Instead, I have discovered I am much more adept at helping others 
			tell their stories. <br/>
			<br/>
			 With this new perspective, along with my educational background and natural affinity for writing, my goal is to help 
			others make their ideas come to life as an editor. Assisting writers and storytellers as they craft their tales by proofreading and offering advice along the way, 
			until the end product is the best possible incarnation of the story they wish to tell, would be quite a fulfilling and exciting career, and is exactly the career I
			am eagerly striving towards. <br/>
