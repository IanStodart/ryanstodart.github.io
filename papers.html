                      <h6 >I observed a developing child ( somewhere between the ages of 6 months and 3 years old), 
                        observe how far their language had developed at that point, record some dialogue, and write a comprehensive 
                        report about the experience, including a transcript of a segment of dialogue in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
                         Doing the research for this paper was an absolute treat; I got to hang out with one of my mother's friends and 
                         her year-and-a-half-old son, Owen, for a few hours, and they were both very kind, fun and entertaining. 
                         Owen was still in the babbling stage of development, but he was very intelligent, and certainly understood a great deal; 
                         his mother did not use "baby talk" or truncated language, she spoke to him as if he were ten years old, and he understood 
                         and listened very well. While I am not interested in pursuing a career in linguistics, I find it to be a very fascinating 
                         subject, and certainly had a great time with this project. </h6>

                      <h6 >Research grant proposal for research to be done in the Monte Verde region in Chile. This region is 
                        believed to have some of the earliest evidence of humans in the area, some evidence dating as far back as about 18,500 
                        years Before Present, which predates the previous "Clovis first" theory by 1,000-3,000 years. This project was incredibly 
                        informative for me because it taught me, for the first time, how to write a research grant proposal, which is something 
                        I may very well end up doing often in the future. It is not a research paper, it is much more; one has to have a firm 
                        knowledge of the region one wishes to research, why they want to conduct new research there, how one will do so, how much 
                        it will cost, when (the exact time frame) the research will be conducted, and what one hopes to gain from the research. 
                        It is an incredibly comprehensive paper, and it needs to be, as the whole purpose of the proposal is to get people to give 
                        the researcher money, and people like to know everything about where their money is going. Doing this project was difficult, 
                        but I am very thankful for it, because of the real-world knowledge and experience it, and my professor, Doctor Garcia, imparted 
                        on me. Now I know how to write a research grant proposal.</h6>

                      </h3>
                      <h6 >An exercise in participant-observation, I went to and observed a Buddhist funeral; a cousin's grandmother (unrelated to me) passed away and 
                        their family is Japanese Buddhist. The mortuary and service were both very pleasant and serene, and it was a very enlightening opportunity, being able to 
                        experience a different culture's burial practices. My family is historically Catholic on my mother's side and Christian on my father's side, so Buddhism 
                        is something markedly different from what I had experienced in the past. I found the fact that Buddhism views of death to be very interesting; they seem to 
                        be much more accepting of death (even though they may feel remorse for their deceased, they do not reject it), possibly due to their belief of the samsara 
                        cycle (life, death, and rebirth), and it was very calming and serene to experience. I am glad that I got the chance to experience a small aspect of another 
                        culture and their traditions, even if it was a bit morbid; I believe that everyone, and anyone, can learn something by experiencing other cultures, even just 
                        small aspects or simple traditions, and I believe more people should make an effort to be more open-mined about others. </h6>

                      <h6 >Sexism, and other forms of cultural discrimination, are unfortunately a very real and ever-present aspect of our society, despite all the progress 
                        our culture has undergone over the last century. The paper on the left is a research paper I did on the prevalence of sexism in the film industry. I was quite 
                        shocked at the staggering statistics I found on the subject, much of it illustrating the discrepancies that exist even to this day. Despite the suffrage movements 
                        of the 1920s and the progressive feminist movements that have been occurring in greater frequency in the 2000s, there is still a large and blatant sexist culture 
                        that percolates all aspects of our society, even at the top levels (especially at the top levels). Reading many accounts of women in the film industry (and I can 
                        only assume women in just about every other industry experience the same) retelling the various and abundant instances of sexism they experience on a daily basis 
                        made me not only upset at the unfortunate reality, but disappointed that, in an age where we often believe we live in an incredibly progressive society, we often 
                        appear to have gone nowhere. </h6>

                      </h3>
                      <h6>Max Gluckman was a social anthropologist from South Africa, and was someone I was tasked (by my professor in my History of Anthropological Theory class) 
                        to research and dissect one of his articles, to observe who he was, as an anthropologist (such has his personal theoretical paradigm), and what he contributed to the 
                        field. This class was a very fascinating class because it introduced me to a great deal of people I had never heard of before, and was a seminar-style class, so each 
                        session was essentially a conversation about the theories and theorists about whom we had previously just read. I always find it interesting to hear other people's opinions; 
                        regardless of the topic, having a discussion about something is much more informative than simply regurgitating facts, and people often have very interesting ideas and 
                        perspectives. Gluckman did a lot of work on, and combating, apartheid in Africa, particularly in South Africa (where he was from), and created the famous Manchester School 
                        in the University of Manchester, which heavily encouraged detailed case studies. He, and many of the other theorists, including Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Franz "Papa" 
                        Boas, was a fascinating individual who paved the way for the anthropology we know today.</h6>
