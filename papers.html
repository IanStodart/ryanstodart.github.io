						   the ages of six and eighteen months and detail the child's language development stage. This includes a transcipt
						   of speech into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The paper details not only the child's speech patterns,
						   but also looks at how his mother spoke to him, a factor that certainly impacts a child's speech development.</h6>

                      <h6 >An important skill for any academic professional is the knowledge of how to write a grant proposal. I wrote this one as an assignment 
						   for an archaeological field methods class during my undergraduate program. 
						   I chose to focus on an archaeological site in Chile called Monte Verde, which at the time was believed to have some of the earliest-dated
						   evidence of humans in the Americas, particularly supporting the "Clovis First" theory of the peopling of the Americas. The paper, being a 
						   grant proposal, includeds travel and equipment expenses, details on housing arrangements, as well as a history on the site and an argument
						   for additional research in the area.</h6>

                        of the 1920s and the progressive feminist movements that have been occurring in greater frequency in the 2000s, there is still a large sexist culture 
                        that percolates all aspects of our society. We often believe we live in an incredibly progressive society, however we still have a long way to go. </h6>

					  and created the famous Manchester School in the University of Manchester, which heavily encouraged detailed case studies. He was a proponent of structural functionalism,
					  which is a theory that states that every aspect of a society has some sort of purpose, hence "functional". He, and many of the other theorists, including Karl Marx, 
					  Emile Durkheim, and Franz Boas, was a fascinating individual who paved the way for the anthropology we know today.</h6>
