             My name is Ryan Stodart. Having studied anthropology for several years and through my own life experiences,
			I can firmly state that stories, and storytelling, is an integral part of what makes humans, human. 
			Whether the story ends in a happily-ever-after or a tragic cliffhanger, stories of all sorts captivate readers, viewers,
			and listeners in all forms of media, including movies and television, comic books and graphic novels, short stories and full-length novels,
			theater plays and paintings, and even verbal storytelling. <br/>
			For as long as I can remember I have had a passion for writing and storytelling. 
			A well-built universe, a diverse cast of unique and relatable characters, solid character development, and an enticing plot
			are all aspects of a good story that serve to hook the consumer and keep them coming back for more. Look no farther that Star Wars or Harry Potter; both of these
			pop culture powerhouses exemplify good storytelling, which is a major reason why they are pop culture powerhouses in the first place.
			While I have made attempts at writing in the past with the hopes of creating something even a quarter as inspirational, I have learned along the way that 
			I am not as much of an idea person. I do not have any great stories rattling around in my head. Instead, I have discovered I am much better at helping others 
			tell their stories. <br/>
			With the perspective I have gained as a student of anthropology and through my past experiences, along with my natural affinity for writing and storytelling, my goal is to help 
			others make their ideas come to like by becoming an editor. To assist writers and storytellers	as they craft their tales, proofreading and offering advice along the way, 
			until the end product is the best possible incarnation of the story they wish to tell, would be the most fulfilling and exciting career one could hope to achieve, and is one that I
			am eagerly striving towards. <br/>
			This website serves to showcase some of the writing I have done over the years, both academically, as part of my undergraduate education, and recreationally, 
			in the form of a few poems and short stories I have dabbled with in the past. My desire in showing this is not to illustrate my work, but more specifically my writing skills
			and versatility, and to convey the idea that my inherent abilities and judgement are worthy of the career I am pursuing. Please take a gander what I offer; read through
			the research papers and maybe learn a thing or two, ponder some of my poems, skim through one of the two short stories I have, the second of which is only the beginning of that particular 
			tale. I hope you enjoy, in some respect, what you see, and if something tickles your fancy, my email and contact information are included within my resume on the last tab. <br/>
			Be well, do good, live long, and prosper.
